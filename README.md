This package has classes for Book, Paper, Publication, and the Publication Manager. I have added a feature to calculate a statistic about the characters in the title of all publications added to the Publication Manager as well as a doi attribute to the Book and Paper. I have added a WebPage class that allows the system to ass references to web links. WebPage inherits from Publication. 
......
I still need to add the method addWebpage to my publication manager. 
Still need to design and implement a way for users to remove citations that were added before.
