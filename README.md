# AssignmentOne.js

A Node project to cite publications that was made with npm and uses an interactive command line user interface.

## [Documentation](#documentation)
To run this project:
```shell
node AssignmentOne.js
```
## Goal and Philosophy
This package has classes for Book, Paper, Publication, and the Publication Manager. I have added a feature to calculate a statistic about the characters in the title of all publications added to the Publication Manager, as well as a doi attribute to Paper and ISBN to Book. I have added a WebPage class that allows the system to add references to web links. WebPage inherits from Publication. This project uses inquirer to easily add and remove citations from the system.
