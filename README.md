## Goal and Philosophy
This package has classes for Book, Paper, Publication, and the Publication Manager. I have added a feature to calculate a statistic about the characters in the title of all publications added to the Publication Manager as well as a doi attribute to Paper and ISBN to Book. I have added a WebPage class that allows the system to add references to web links. WebPage inherits from Publication. I've added inquirer to facilitate users ability to add and remove citations.
